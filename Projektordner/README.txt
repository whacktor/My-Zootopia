Animals Web Generator

This project generates a simple HTML website with information about animals.
The animal data is fetched dynamically from the API Ninjas Animals API based on user input.

The project demonstrates:
- API usage
- Environment variable management with dotenv
- Separation of concerns (data fetching vs. website generation)
- Basic HTML generation using Python
